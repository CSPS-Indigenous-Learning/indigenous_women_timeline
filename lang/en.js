        content: "<p>Kateri Tekakwitha or Tekaouïta (baptised Catherine), known as the Lily of the Mohawks, first North American Aboriginal person elevated to sainthood (born in 1656 at Ossernenon in Iroquois country, now Auriesville, <abbr title=\"New York\">NY</abbr>; died 17 April 1680 at the <abbr title=\"Saint\">St.</abbr> Francis Xavier Mission at <span lang=\"fr\">Sault <abbr title=\"Saint\">St.</abbr> Louis</span>, New France, now Kahnawake). Tekakwitha was born to a Mohawk father and Algonquin mother. She was orphaned in 1660 at the age of four when a smallpox epidemic wiped out most of her village, killing her parents and younger brother.</p><p>Tekakwitha made friends with Father <span lang=\"fr\">Jacques de Lamberville</span> who was in charge of the mission. In 1675, she shared with him her desire to be baptized. <span lang=\"fr\">Lamberville</span> taught her the catechism and at Easter 1676, baptized her as Catherine. Tekakwitha was then 20 years old. Her baptism and subsequent first communion in 1677 made her the target of persecution in her village. With the help of Father <span lang=\"fr\">Lamberville</span>, Catherine, along with other converted Mohawks travelled several hundred kilometres to reach the <span lang=\"fr\"><abbr title=\"Saint\">St.</abbr> Francis Xavier</span> Mission at <span lang=\"fr\">Sault <abbr title=\"Saint\">St.</abbr> Louis</span> (today the Kahnawake reserve).</p><p>In 1681, Father Chauchetière wrote a biography of Catherine and painted her portrait. In another biography, written by Father <span lang=\"fr\">Cholenec</span> in 1696, the author reports that 15 minutes after Catherine’s death the smallpox scars disappeared and her face became white and shone with beauty. For the Jesuits this was the first miracle and the birth of the legend of the Iroquois virgin, Catherine Tekakwitha.</p><p>Catherine’s story has been told in more than 300 books and 20 languages since her death. These accounts have served not only to spread the word about her cult in Canada but also in the United States and around the world. Patron saint of the environment and of Aboriginal people, her intervention is called upon in cases of illness. In the province of Quebec two churches are named after her, one in the Innu community of Mashteuiash in the <span lang=\"fr\">Saguenay Lac <abbr title=\"Saint\">St.</abbr> Jean</span> region, the other in the Innu community of Uashat Mak Maliotenam near <span lang=\"fr\">Sept-Îles</span>. A statue of Catherine stands in the Basilica of <span lang=\"fr\">Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré</span>. She was also featured in Montreal author Leonard Cohen’s novel Beautiful Losers (1966).</p><p>While Canadian Catholics see this sainthood as a source of pride, others view Catherine Tekakwitha as a powerless victim of colonialism. It is true that in the numerous biographies written about her, authors often give more pages to the legend than to the historical context. In a period when the Catholic Church wanted to encourage the conversion of Aboriginal peoples, her mysticism and piety made Catherine a model to follow.</p>"

Hind was a founding member of the Winnipeg branch of the Canadian Women’s Press Club. At the time, female journalists were not allowed to become members of the Canadian Press Club.
