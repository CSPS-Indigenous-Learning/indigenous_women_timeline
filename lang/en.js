        content: "<p>Kateri Tekakwitha or Tekaouïta (baptised Catherine), known as the Lily of the Mohawks, first North American Aboriginal person elevated to sainthood (born in 1656 at Ossernenon in Iroquois country, now Auriesville, <abbr title=\"New York\">NY</abbr>; died 17 April 1680 at the <abbr title=\"Saint\">St.</abbr> Francis Xavier Mission at <span lang=\"fr\">Sault <abbr title=\"Saint\">St.</abbr> Louis</span>, New France, now Kahnawake). Tekakwitha was born to a Mohawk father and Algonquin mother. She was orphaned in 1660 at the age of four when a smallpox epidemic wiped out most of her village, killing her parents and younger brother.</p><p>Tekakwitha made friends with Father <span lang=\"fr\">Jacques de Lamberville</span> who was in charge of the mission. In 1675, she shared with him her desire to be baptized. <span lang=\"fr\">Lamberville</span> taught her the catechism and at Easter 1676, baptized her as Catherine. Tekakwitha was then 20 years old. Her baptism and subsequent first communion in 1677 made her the target of persecution in her village. With the help of Father <span lang=\"fr\">Lamberville</span>, Catherine, along with other converted Mohawks travelled several hundred kilometres to reach the <span lang=\"fr\"><abbr title=\"Saint\">St.</abbr> Francis Xavier</span> Mission at <span lang=\"fr\">Sault <abbr title=\"Saint\">St.</abbr> Louis</span> (today the Kahnawake reserve).</p><p>In 1681, Father Chauchetière wrote a biography of Catherine and painted her portrait. In another biography, written by Father <span lang=\"fr\">Cholenec</span> in 1696, the author reports that 15 minutes after Catherine’s death the smallpox scars disappeared and her face became white and shone with beauty. For the Jesuits this was the first miracle and the birth of the legend of the Iroquois virgin, Catherine Tekakwitha.</p><p>Catherine’s story has been told in more than 300 books and 20 languages since her death. These accounts have served not only to spread the word about her cult in Canada but also in the United States and around the world. Patron saint of the environment and of Aboriginal people, her intervention is called upon in cases of illness. In the province of Quebec two churches are named after her, one in the Innu community of Mashteuiash in the <span lang=\"fr\">Saguenay Lac <abbr title=\"Saint\">St.</abbr> Jean</span> region, the other in the Innu community of Uashat Mak Maliotenam near <span lang=\"fr\">Sept-Îles</span>. A statue of Catherine stands in the Basilica of <span lang=\"fr\">Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré</span>. She was also featured in Montreal author Leonard Cohen’s novel Beautiful Losers (1966).</p><p>While Canadian Catholics see this sainthood as a source of pride, others view Catherine Tekakwitha as a powerless victim of colonialism. It is true that in the numerous biographies written about her, authors often give more pages to the legend than to the historical context. In a period when the Catholic Church wanted to encourage the conversion of Aboriginal peoples, her mysticism and piety made Catherine a model to follow.</p>"

Hind secured a job working for a lawyer named Hugh John Macdonald (the son of Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald who later became a politician and premier of Manitoba). Macdonald’s law office purchased the first typewriter in Winnipeg.

Then in In 1901, editor John W. Dafoe of the Manitoba Free Press offered Hind a job as an agricultural editor. Tramping through fields to examine crops, she earned an international reputation as an agricultural journalist and &ldquo;the oracle of wheat&rdquo; for her accurate harvest yield predictions. Hind was a founding member of the Winnipeg branch of the Canadian Women’s Press Club. At the time, female journalists were not allowed to become members of the Canadian Press Club. Hind used her status to advocate for women in journalism and in the community.</p><p>A pioneer throughout her life, Hind was an acclaimed grain expert, a champion of women’s rights and an advocate for the franchise.

Louise McKinney was the first woman elected to a legislature in Canada and in the British Empire. A member of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (<abbr>WCTU</abbr>) and a devout Methodist, she dedicated her life to good works in the service of others. She is also known as a pioneer suffragist and member of the Famous Five. Her signature appears on the legal petition to recognize women as persons under the Constitution, allowing them to serve in appointed positions, such as in the Senate of Canada.</p><p>In 1888, the Dominion <abbr title=\"Woman’s Christian Temperance Union\">WCTU</abbr> endorsed women’s suffrage in Canada.

Along with Henrietta Edwards, she helped bring about the Dower Act, initiated by Magistrate Emily Murphy, vital legislation that protected a married woman’s property rights. McKinney ran for office again in 1921, as a member of the United Farmers of Alberta, but lost. She did not run for office again.</p><p>Women’s rights were always at the forefront of McKinney’s actions. As a lay preacher, McKinney made the case for women to become ministers in the Methodist church and later in the United Church&ThinSpace;&ndash;&ThinSpace;but her proposals were not approved. In 1925, the Methodist Church, Presbyterian, Congregational and the General Council of the Local Union Churches were amalgamated into the United Church of Canada.
