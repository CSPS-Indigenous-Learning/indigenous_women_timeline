        content: "<p>Kateri Tekakwitha ou Tekaouïta, (baptisée Catherine), surnommée «&ThinSpace;le Lys des Agniers ou Lys des Mohawks&ThinSpace;», première Autochtone d'Amérique du Nord à être canonisée par l’Église catholique (née en 1656 à Ossernenon en Iroquoisie, aujourd’hui Auriesville dans l’État de New York; décédée le 17 avril 1680 à la mission de Saint-François-Xavier, au Sault-Saint-Louis, aujourd’hui Kahnawake). Fille d’un père agnier (terme traditionnel français pour désigner les Mohawks) et d’une mère algonquine, elle devient orpheline à l’âge de 4 ans. En 1660, ses parents et son jeune frère, ainsi que la plupart des habitants de son village, sont décimés par une épidémie de variole.</p><p>Tekakwitha se lie avec le père Jacques de Lamberville qui dirige la mission. En 1675, elle lui fait part de son désir de recevoir le baptême. Lamberville lui enseigne le catéchisme et à Pâques 1676, il la baptise sous le nom de Catherine. Elle a alors 20 ans. Son baptême, puis sa première communion en 1677, auraient engendré des persécutions de la part de son groupe, ce qui la pousse à quitter son village. Avec l’aide du père Lamberville, elle franchit, en compagnie d’autres Mohawks convertis, plusieurs centaines de kilomètres afin de rejoindre la mission chrétienne de Saint-François-Xavier, située au Sault-Saint-Louis (aujourd’hui la réserve de Kahnawake)</p><p>Dès 1681, le père Chauchetière peint un portrait d’elle et rédige sa biographie. Dans celle publiée par le père Cholonec en 1696, ce dernier rapporte qu’une quinzaine de minutes après la mort de Catherine, les marques de la petite vérole seraient disparues de son visage et que celui-ci serait devenu blanc et rayonnant de beauté. Pour les Jésuites, il s’agissait là d’un premier miracle. C’est ainsi que naît la légende autour de celle que l’on nomme la vierge iroquoise, Catherine Tekakwitha.</p><p>Depuis sa mort, son histoire a été racontée dans plus de 300 ouvrages et dans une vingtaine de langues. Ces récits ont contribué non seulement à faire connaître son culte au Canada, mais aussi aux États-Unis et à travers le monde. Patronne de l’environnement et des Autochtones, on fait appel à elle dans la maladie. Au Québec, deux églises portent son nom, l’une dans la communauté innue (montagnaise) de Mashteuiash, dans la région du Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean et l’autre, dans la communauté innue d’Uashat Mak Maliotenam à proximité de Sept-Îles sur la Côte-Nord. On trouve une statue de Sainte Kateri à la basilique de Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré. Elle est aussi une figure importante du roman du montréalais Leonard Cohen, <span lang=\"en\">Beautiful Losers</span> (1966) traduit en français sous le titre Les perdants magnifiques (1972).</p><p>Si pour les catholiques canadiens, sa sainteté est l’objet d’une fierté, d’autres voient en Catherine Tekakwitha une victime impuissante du colonialisme. En effet, dans les nombreuses biographies qui lui sont consacrées, les auteurs ont souvent fait plus de place à la légende qu’au contexte historique. À une époque où l’Église catholique souhaitait encourager les conversions chez les Autochtones, son mysticisme et sa piété ont fait d’elle un modèle à suivre et à imiter.</p>"

From the age of two, Catherine lived in the Credit Mission, a settlement of Ojibwa people converted to Christianity and missionaries, interpreters and teachers. After returning to the Credit Mission, Catherine married an English Methodist and shoemaker, originally from Lincolnshire, England, William Sutton. William was not Indigenous but expressed a deep interest in the welfare of Indigenous peoples. He and Catherine had eight children together.</p><p>When the Sutton family returned to the Owen Sound area in 1857, they found themselves in crisis; their land was being sold by the federal government after some band members signed a treaty that surrendered their Aboriginal title. Sutton and her family no longer had rights to the land they once claimed as home. Upset with federal government’s treatment of her and her people, Catherine proceeded to take her case to a higher power&ThinSpace;&ndash;&ThinSpace;the British Crown.</p><p>Catherine successfully petitioned to Queen Victoria to intervene in a land claim dispute near Owen Sound, Ontario. The Queen granted Catherine legal ownership, however the Canadian government did not honour the Queen's decision.

She taught there for seven years. In 1852, Stowe applied to Victoria College in Cobourg, Ontario. She was not admitted because she was female. Stowe then applied to the Normal School for Upper Canada (Toronto),which was the only advanced school in Canada that accepted women. Stowe was accepted in 1853 and graduated in 1854 with first-class honours. After graduating, Stowe accepted a job with the Brantford school board and soon became the first female principal of a public school in Ontario. She worked as a principal in Brantford until 1856.<p>Stowe applied to the Toronto School of Medicine in 1865 but was not accepted. At that time, women were not admitted to medical schools in Canada. Stowe left Canada to attend the New York Medical College for Women, which taught homeopathic medicine. Stowe returned to Canada in 1867 and opened a medical practice on Richmond Street in Toronto. She specialized in treating diseases of women and children.<p>Throughout her medical career, Stowe fought for equality between men and women. She believed that women deserved the opportunity to earn the same credentials as men, whether in medicine, law or any other area of study. Stowe helped to create the Toronto Women’s Literary Club (<abbr>TWLC</abbr>) in 1876–77. In 1889, Stowe helped create a nationwide organization devoted to female suffrage called the Dominion Women’s Enfranchisement Association (DWEA).

In her position, Stowe used various strategies to influence political change: lobbying, petitions, rallies, speeches, and newspaper editorials.</p><p>While the Ontario Medical College for Women closed in 1905, its Dispensary inspired the creation of a hospital run by women for women. In 1909,a group called the Women’s College Hospital Committee campaigned for a female-run hospital. The Dispensary was renamed Women’s College Hospital and Dispensary in 1913. The original hospital had seven beds but grew larger over the years and continues to operate.

The novel is set around the time when the people still had limited contact with outsiders. As a result, it preserves cultural history as well as preserving language. Nappaaluk wrote the book with the aim of it being an educational resource for learning and preserving her native languages as well as entertainment. The novel was published in French in 2002 and English in 2014. Nappaaluk would later translate the Roman Catholic Book of Prayer into Inuktitut as well as authored several books for children on the language.

Through her lifetime of tireless advocacy, she has advanced the fair and equal treatment of Indigenous people within all levels of society. Born in 1937 in Lamont, Alberta, Muriel and her twin brother Wesley were the second-eldest of ten children. They grew up in Whitford, Alberta, named after their great-uncle Andrew Whitford, who built the first school in the area. When she was in Grade 10, Muriel contracted tuberculosis (<abbr>TB</abbr>), forcing her to enter the Aberhart Memorial Sanatorium in Edmonton for a year, isolated and alone. Having lost her uncle, aunt and their baby to <abbr title=\"tuberculosis\">TB</abbr>, all within eight months, Muriel feared her fate.</p><p>When she was 17, Muriel married Albert Venne, eventually having four children together. The marriage ended violently. Initially, Muriel was hesitant to talk about the experience, but as time went on, her experiences and strength set her on a new path. Muriel became one of the first advocates to speak out against similar abuse experienced by Indigenous women. As Muriel built her new life, she knew she wanted a university education. After gaining entrance to the University of Alberta, she worked on her education degree for three years. But the demands of raising four children while going to school proved too costly. Muriel left her studies and began working at the Métis Association of Alberta where she started the Native Outreach program. Muriel’s career in workforce development saw her go on to implement a variety of successful programs that inspired a rethinking of the role of Indigenous people in the work force.</p><p>Muriel’s advocacy took on an added dimension in 1973 when Premier Peter Lougheed recognized her strength and compassion by appointing her as one of the first seven commissioners to the Alberta Human Rights Commission. That appointment brought her into the public realm of education and advocacy. So, began her long history of working tirelessly to bring Indigenous human rights issues to the forefront. In 1994, Muriel was inspired to establish the Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women (<abbr>IAAW</abbr>) as she helped a student navigate the legal system. Muriel created an organization that builds community while educating people, specifically about the experience and accomplishments of Indigenous women.</p><p>Muriel was instrumental in producing <em>The Rights Path-Alberta</em>, a comprehensive publication that informs Indigenous people about their human rights. So significant was its publication that Muriel presented a copy to Mary Robinson, then United Nations (<abbr>UN</abbr>) High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 1998. When <abbr title=\"United Nations\">UN</abbr> Rapporteur James Anaya came to Maskwacis, Alberta, in 2013, Muriel made a passionate and eloquent presentation about the state of Indigenous women’s lives in Canada. Perhaps her most significant achievement is changing how Canadian law and criminal justice systems respond to systemic violence against Indigenous women. There are now 231 Calls for Justice to be implemented to see the systemic change that Muriel and other advocates expect.</p><p>Muriel has received many honours for her work. In 1998, on the 25th anniversary of the Alberta Human Rights Commission, she received the Alberta Human Rights Award for her lifelong contributions to social justice. In 2005, she was the first Métis person to receive the Order of Canada for her human rights advocacy and for bringing national attention to the crisis of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls. That same year, she also received the Governor General’s Commemorative Award for the Persons Case. She is a recipient of the Queen Elizabeth <abbr title=\"2\">II</abbr>’s Golden and Diamond Jubilee Medals, and the Alberta Centennial Medal. In 2010, she received a Distinguished Citizen Honourary Bachelor of Arts Degree from MacEwan University.</p><p>Muriel was the first Indigenous woman to have an Alberta government building named in her honour.

She soon decided she wanted to fly planes herself. In 2003, Haney took flight lessons in Cornwall, Ontario. The following year, she completed ground school courses with Air Inuit. One of Haney's mentors has been aviator Johnny May, the first Inuk bush pilot in Nunavik. In 2004, Haney began flying Twin Otter aircraft for Air Inuit. In the summer of 2016, Haney was promoted to captain. When she flew back to Inukjuak in September, several hundred people from her community gathered to meet her at the airport. She now regularly flies a Dash 8 Combi-300, making tight landings on runways that are often just barely long enough for her aircraft. Melissa cares deeply for people in Canada’s north, and their cultural history, and does all she can to help connect southerners with them.</p>"

Nakogee Elementary School, which had been housed in makeshift portables since 2000, when it had been condemned and closed due to a decades-old fuel leak. Shannen then realized that the government was not giving proper funding to First Nations Aboriginal schooling systems around Canada, and that's when her dream/movement came to be. By 2007, the federal government had backed away from a third commitment to building a new school for Attawapiskat. In response, Koostachin and others turned to YouTube and Facebook to launch the Students Helping Students campaign for a school for Attawapiskat. Koostachin spoke out about the experiences of her community in newspapers, at conferences, and on the steps of Parliament Hill in 2008. In 2009, at the age of 14, she was nominated for the International Children’s Peace Prize.</p><p>Koostachin and her older sister, Serena, moved hundreds of kilometres away from Attawapiskat to New Liskeard, Ontario, for high school. On June 1, 2010, Shannen died as a result of a car accident. A monument to Shannen Koostachin, with a statue depicting her dressed in regalia, was unveiled in New Liskeard in 2015. In 2017, Shannen was named one of 150 greatest Canadians.</p><p>Shannen's Dream was formed after Koostachin’s death, and is one of many social justice campaigns carried out by the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society. Shannen's Dream is a student&ThinSpace;&ndash;&ThinSpace;and youth-focused campaign designed to raise awareness about inequitable funding for First Nations children. It encourages supporters to write letters to their Member of Parliament, the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, and the Prime Minister of Canada. To accompany this movement, Timmins-James Bay <abbr title=\"Membrer of Parliament\">MP</abbr> Charlie Angus reintroduced Shannen's Dream as Motion 201 to the House of Commons of Canada on September 26, 2011. On February 27, 2012, the House of Commons unanimously voted in favour of the motion.</p>"

        content: "<p>Captain Robyn Shlachetka and first officer Raven Beardy never intended to make history. In fact, the pair became Manitoba’s first female Indigenous medevac team entirely by accident. On March 5, the two weren’t scheduled to fly together for Missinippi Airways, but Shlachetka’s usual first officer took some unexpected time off and Beardy volunteered to take that empty spot. After snapping a photo to commemorate this occasion, the pair sent the image to Shlachetka’s mother, who quickly posted it to Facebook. Over the next couple days, the post garnered plenty of attention beyond their usual circle of family and friends, having been shared almost 12,000 times by March 8. Outside of serving as an inspiration to women and Indigenous people, Shlachetka and Beardy’s story is also very unique to the north, since they hail from Wabowden and Shamattawa, respectively.</p><p>For Beardy, growing up in a fly-in community really exposed her to how important these medevac services are, especially when she was personally airlifted as a little girl due to complications with her appendix. This experience also taught her how Indigenous representation was really lacking in the aviation industry at that point. Meanwhile, Shlachetka said she wanted to be a pilot from as far back as she can remember, since her father worked as a bush pilot, which gave her plenty of exposure to flying as a kid.</p><p>While Shlachetka is keen to tell all their would-be recruits that being a medevac pilot in Northern Manitoba is very rewarding, she also warns that it is not for the faint of heart. Unlike a lot of commercial airways like Air Canada and West Jet, medevac pilots are expected to complete their assignments regardless of the flying conditions they encounter.</p><p>Beardy and Shlachetka are in the middle of trying to open up a flight training program in Thompson. While the finer details of this program haven’t been finalized yet, the pair is hoping to put something online in the upcoming summer months.</p>"
