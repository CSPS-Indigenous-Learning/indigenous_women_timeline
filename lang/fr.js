        content: "<p>Kateri Tekakwitha ou Tekaouïta, (baptisée Catherine), surnommée «&ThinSpace;le Lys des Agniers ou Lys des Mohawks&ThinSpace;», première Autochtone d'Amérique du Nord à être canonisée par l’Église catholique (née en 1656 à Ossernenon en Iroquoisie, aujourd’hui Auriesville dans l’État de New York; décédée le 17 avril 1680 à la mission de Saint-François-Xavier, au Sault-Saint-Louis, aujourd’hui Kahnawake). Fille d’un père agnier (terme traditionnel français pour désigner les Mohawks) et d’une mère algonquine, elle devient orpheline à l’âge de 4 ans. En 1660, ses parents et son jeune frère, ainsi que la plupart des habitants de son village, sont décimés par une épidémie de variole.</p><p>Tekakwitha se lie avec le père Jacques de Lamberville qui dirige la mission. En 1675, elle lui fait part de son désir de recevoir le baptême. Lamberville lui enseigne le catéchisme et à Pâques 1676, il la baptise sous le nom de Catherine. Elle a alors 20 ans. Son baptême, puis sa première communion en 1677, auraient engendré des persécutions de la part de son groupe, ce qui la pousse à quitter son village. Avec l’aide du père Lamberville, elle franchit, en compagnie d’autres Mohawks convertis, plusieurs centaines de kilomètres afin de rejoindre la mission chrétienne de Saint-François-Xavier, située au Sault-Saint-Louis (aujourd’hui la réserve de Kahnawake)</p><p>Dès 1681, le père Chauchetière peint un portrait d’elle et rédige sa biographie. Dans celle publiée par le père Cholonec en 1696, ce dernier rapporte qu’une quinzaine de minutes après la mort de Catherine, les marques de la petite vérole seraient disparues de son visage et que celui-ci serait devenu blanc et rayonnant de beauté. Pour les Jésuites, il s’agissait là d’un premier miracle. C’est ainsi que naît la légende autour de celle que l’on nomme la vierge iroquoise, Catherine Tekakwitha.</p><p>Depuis sa mort, son histoire a été racontée dans plus de 300 ouvrages et dans une vingtaine de langues. Ces récits ont contribué non seulement à faire connaître son culte au Canada, mais aussi aux États-Unis et à travers le monde. Patronne de l’environnement et des Autochtones, on fait appel à elle dans la maladie. Au Québec, deux églises portent son nom, l’une dans la communauté innue (montagnaise) de Mashteuiash, dans la région du Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean et l’autre, dans la communauté innue d’Uashat Mak Maliotenam à proximité de Sept-Îles sur la Côte-Nord. On trouve une statue de Sainte Kateri à la basilique de Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré. Elle est aussi une figure importante du roman du montréalais Leonard Cohen, <span lang=\"en\">Beautiful Losers</span> (1966) traduit en français sous le titre Les perdants magnifiques (1972).</p><p>Si pour les catholiques canadiens, sa sainteté est l’objet d’une fierté, d’autres voient en Catherine Tekakwitha une victime impuissante du colonialisme. En effet, dans les nombreuses biographies qui lui sont consacrées, les auteurs ont souvent fait plus de place à la légende qu’au contexte historique. À une époque où l’Église catholique souhaitait encourager les conversions chez les Autochtones, son mysticisme et sa piété ont fait d’elle un modèle à suivre et à imiter.</p>"

In 1945, when Bernard was 9 years old, her mother was told that if she did not sign the consent forms to send her children to a residential school, the child welfare system would take her children into &ldquo;protective custody&rdquo;; as a result, Bernard attended the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School for five years.</p><p>In 1995, Bernard began an organization to represent survivors of the Shubenacadie school. She subsequently convinced Halifax lawyer John McKiggan to represent the Shubenacadie survivors in a class-action suit.

In McKiggan’s words, &ldquo;(&hellip;) if it wasn’t for Nora’s efforts, and other survivors like her across Canada, this national settlement never would have happened. (&hellip;) After we filed our lawsuit, a number of other students from other schools filed similar class actions.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2005, she testified before the House of Commons of Canada about the abuse children suffered in residential schools. Nora passed away on December 27, 2007, however her legacy and courage to seek justice for the survivors of the Canadian Indian residential school system continues today.</p><p>On December 27, 2007, Bernard was found dead in her home in Truro, Nova Scotia; although she was originally thought to have died of natural causes, on December 31, police arrested her grandson James Douglas Gloade and charged him with her murder. She had been stabbed to death. On January 23, 2009, Gloade was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison.</p><p>In 2008 Bernard was posthumously awarded the Order of Nova Scotia.</p>"
